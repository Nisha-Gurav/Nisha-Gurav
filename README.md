### Projects:
- **Online Food Ordering System üçΩÔ∏è**: [Project Link](https://github.com/Nisha-Gurav/Online-Food-Ordering-system) <br /> 
Its is a web-based application developed using Python Django for the backend and HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the frontend. It offers a user-friendly interface, allowing customers to easily browse menus, place orders, and track their orders in real time. The system includes an admin dashboard for managing menus, viewing incoming orders, and monitoring sales. Secure authentication is implemented with Django‚Äôs built-in features, ensuring a smooth and secure user experience. The platform is designed to be responsive and accessible, leveraging Bootstrap for a modern and intuitive UI.

- **Easy Power Predictor**: [Project Link](https://github.com/Nisha-Gurav/Easy-Power-Predictor.git) <br /> 
It is a machine learning-based model designed to predict the energy consumption of a city. This predictive model provides city planners with valuable insights, helping them forecast future energy demands, optimize resource allocation, and implement more efficient energy management strategies. By leveraging historical data and advanced machine learning techniques, the model can analyze patterns in energy usage and deliver accurate predictions, ultimately aiding in sustainable urban development and energy conservation efforts.

- **Library Management System**: [Project Link](https://github.com/Nisha-Gurav/Library-Management-System.git) <br /> 
The Library Management System is a application developed using Python's Tkinter for the GUI and SQLite for the backend database. It allows efficient management of a library's inventory by enabling users to add, update, and delete book records, track book availability, and manage the issuing and returning of books. The system provides features like real-time inventory updates, book status tracking, and issuer card management, all through a user-friendly interface. This tool simplifies library operations, making it easy for librarians to maintain organized and accurate records.
